# Custom NER Model for Automotive Diagnostic Comments

This project is a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model designed to identify specific entities in automotive diagnostic comments. The model is trained to detect entities such as defective components, parts, failure types, and associated costs. The goal is to enable structured extraction of key information from unstructured diagnostic text data.

## Project Overview
Automotive diagnostics involve a lot of unstructured comments with valuable information, which can be hard to extract and analyze at scale. This NER model is designed to solve that problem by identifying specific entities in these comments, such as:
- **Defective Components**: e.g., engine, ECU, sensor
- **Types of Failures**: e.g., error, defect, warning
- **Parts Replaced**: Number of parts replaced (if any)
- **Cost**: Cost incurred in repairs

The model was built and trained using `spaCy` with custom entity patterns to match domain-specific entities.

## Features
- Identifies entities related to defective components, types of failures, and costs.
- Extracts structured data from unstructured diagnostic comments for further analysis.
- Achieves high accuracy through custom pattern matching and training on annotated data.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `spaCy` and required libraries

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Custom-NER-Automotive-Diagnostics.git
   cd Custom-NER-Automotive-Diagnostics
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the English model for spaCy:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## Data Preparation
1. Ensure your data is in the format expected by the model, with fields such as `Component`, `Failure`, `DefectivePart`, `PartsReplaced`, `Cost`, and `DealerComment_English`.
2. Place your training data in a CSV file, e.g., `train_data.csv`.
3. Run the data cleaning and preprocessing script to prepare your data for training.

## Training the Model
To train the model on your dataset, use the `train_model.py` script. This script prepares the data, trains the NER model, and saves the trained model to disk.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

The model is saved in the `custom_ner_model` directory by default.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance on test data, use `evaluate_model.py`, which calculates the precision, recall, and F1 score for your test set. This script can be modified to load different test datasets.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

## Usage
To use the trained model for inference on new data, load the model and run predictions:

```python
import spacy

# Load the trained model
nlp = spacy.load('./custom_ner_model')

# Sample text
text = "The engine control unit showed an error message. Replaced 1 sensor and incurred a cost of 150 euros."

# Process the text with the model
doc = nlp(text)

# Print recognized entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"Text: {ent.text}, Label: {ent.label_}")
```

## Example
A sample output from the model might look like:

```plaintext
Text: engine control unit, Label: DEFECTIVE_COMPONENT
Text: error message, Label: TYPE_OF_FAILURE
Text: 1 sensor, Label: NUM_PARTS_REPLACED
Text: 150 euros, Label: TOTAL_COST_INCURRED
```

## Results
After training on domain-specific data, the model achieves the following evaluation metrics:
- **Precision**: *x.xx*
- **Recall**: *x.xx*
- **F1 Score**: *x.xx*

*(Replace with actual results after evaluation)*
